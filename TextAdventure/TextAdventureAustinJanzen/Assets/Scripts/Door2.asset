  gameText: This appears to be the burial chamber of a prominent member of the family.
    There is a rather expensive looking coffin (dark brown wood with gold patterns
    all over) sitting in front of a 10-foot tall marble statue of a man with his left
    arm outstretched. Do you open the coffin (1), examine the statue (2), or return
    to the main chamber (3)?
