  gameText: You have a moment of clarity and recognize this man from the mural outside,
    the one fighting the large beast. You place your bow in his hand and hear a series
    of locking sounds. A small chest lifts from the ground at the base of the statue.
    You open it and collect what you estimate to be around 200 gold. Press 1 to return
    to the main chamber.
