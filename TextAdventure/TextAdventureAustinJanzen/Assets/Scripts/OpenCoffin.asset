  gameText: There's a skeleton in here, presumably of the statue guy. The skin and
    flesh has long since rotted away. There are the tattered remains of what must
    have once been fine clothes and a prominent emerald ring on one of his fingers.
    Press 1 to take the ring, press 2 to close the coffin.
