  gameText: You work the large ring off the skeleton's hand. It is gold, with a large
    emerald on top, cut into an oval. As you are examining it's craftsmanship you
    hear a low rumble. You look up instintively just to see several large boulders
    land on your head. You die of blunt force trauma. Game Over.
